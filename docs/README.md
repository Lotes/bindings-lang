# Qu√§ry

## My personal goals

I want to have fun while developing my own query language. Since it is not my first time in doing this, it is the first time where I document my experience.

I want to spread knowledge about compiler construction.

I want to gain new experience to become a wise and old man.

## The project goal

You should have gained the ability to develop your own compiler, debugger, IDE, UI.
