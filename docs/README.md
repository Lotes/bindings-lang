## Goals

### My personal goals

I want to have fun while developing my own query language. Since it is not my first time in doing this, it is the first time where I document my experience.

I want to spread knowledge about compiler construction.

I want to gain new experience to become a wise and old man.

The tutorial should be simple and short. Big snippets of source code are a no-go. Concepts over implementation.

### Your achievements after completing

You should have gained the knowledge to understand the theory behind computer language engineering.

You should have gained the ability to develop your own compiler, debugger, IDE, UI.

## Subject

Here I will sketch the features of the language. I will try to extend the concepts piece for piece.
Short examples are better for mental processing. Nevertheless... if something sounds hard or weird, please let me know.

The language that I will develop has the following features:

* Knowledge
  * formal languages
  * collect syntax an semantics ideas
  * write grammar
